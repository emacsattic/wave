This package enables Emacs to view, play and split raw PCM sound
files.

I wrote it because I sample lots of vinyl to be able to play it in a
more convenient manner -- namely, from my hard disk.  So, I sample one
LP a go and then split the ~600MB raw PCM file into chunks with the
vsplit program.  It tries to find pauses in the sound and splits the
files there.  However, some albums have much hiss and cracle and pop,
so it's not able to find the pauses.  Which brings us to what this
package does: It displays the PCM files in a buffer, allows you to
zoom in on areas, mark positions for splitting and play arbitrary
areas.  So, it's not a traditional sound editor -- it's very much
geared towards splitting large files up into smaller chunks.

It requires ALSA 0.9.0beta6 with the patch in this package applied.
This is to allow alsaplayer to seek to a specific place in the file,
so that you can play from anywhere in the raw PCM file.

How to use it:

Type "make" in this directory.  Move "bsplit" and "summarize" to some
directory you have in your exec path.  Move wave.el to some directory
you have in your `load-path'.  Put the following in your .emacs:

(autoload 'wave-file "wave" nil t)

The C programs wants stereo, 16 bit, 44.1kHz raw PCM files.  If you
have wav files, you can use sox to convert them to raw PCM like this:

  sox file.wav -c 2 -s -w -r 44100 file.raw

Then type `M-x wave-file RET /some/file.raw'.  You will then be
presented with a buffer displaying the contents of the file, and you
can zoom with the `z' command, `q' will unzoom (or quit if you're
already unzoomed), `s' will set a split point, and `S' will split the
file using the external bsplit program.

This is neither big nor clever, but it does what I want it to do.
